# air-quality-level-prediction-model
This repository contains a Streamlit-based web application for predicting air quality levels using a trained Voting Classifier (Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM). Users can input environmental parameters (e.g., Temperature, Humidity, PM2.5, NOâ‚‚) to get real-time air quality predictions.
